# SearchEngines
A spider crawls the web and collects new and existing data.

The data is stored in an index with details like keywords and metadata.

When searching with the engine, the data is ranked by heuristics such as relevance, quality, and context.

The results are then provided.

Analysis of user behavior, feedback, and new data on the web allow for continuous improvements.

Some search engines have given more authority and rank to data which has more incoming links.

Search engines can incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence to understand context, synonyms, and the intent behind a search query.
