# Assign Recreational Teams Naively
- Coaches create assessments for all players using a float between 0 and 5.
- Each player score determined by the average of all coach scores.
- Every coach has a playersList and an assignedList.
- For each player assigned to coach,
    - put those players in the coach's assignedList.
- Group the players assigned to players.
- For each group,
    - get the coaches with the least number of players in the assignedList
    - randomly select one of the coaches with least number in assignedList
    - assign the group into that coach's assignedList.
- Remove the all players in all coach's assignedList from the mainList of players.
- Sort the coaches however you want into coachList
    - numbers in a hat
    - draw straws
    - randomize
- Sort the mainList of players from highest to lowest score.
- For each coach in sorted coachList,
    - get nextPlayer in mainList with highest score
    - if coach has none in their assignedList add player to coach's playersList
    - else if coach has any player in their assignedList
        - if nextPlayer has higher score than all others in coach's assignedList
            - add nextPlayer to coach's playersList
        - else move highest score player from assignedList to coach's playersList
            - and begin checking if nextPlayer should go to the next coach
- Verify that all players have teams
- Verify that no team has two more players than any other team
- Verify that total team score is similar to all other team scores
