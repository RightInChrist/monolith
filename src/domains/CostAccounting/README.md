We can pay dollars to use computers and electricity in various ways to help share the good news Jesus commissioned us, his servants, to perform.

Tools have costs.  For example, a computer requires electricity.  And so the tools on computers come with a cost.  There is a limited supply of electricity and people will put a dollar price on the electricity and give the computer with its electricity to those who can pay enough dollar price in comparison to all the other people wanting to pay for the computer with its electricity.  Supply and demand.

The price of the computer and its electricity being used to feed the world is impacted by many other activities like the demand for watching and listening content on the internet.  And so those of us who love God and people should consider the money we give to Amazon and Netflix for example.  And then we can compare that to the money we give towards using computers and electricity to help feed the world better fruits than those which are produced by Amazon and Netflix.

The information I have written here can be shared with people in ways which cost different amounts of dollars.  My king Jesus taught the good news that the kingdom of God and heaven is available to all.  Knowing God in the way a woman knows a man and gives birth to a child is available to all.  And so we can use computers and electricity in various ways to help share the good news Jesus commissioned us to perform.

I store these words using a technology called `git` which is used to track changes to collections of words over time.  There are companies which allow these words to be stored on their computers at no charge to me.  I currently use github which is owned by Microsoft.  But there are other options like gitlab, bitbucket, and many more which will host my words for free.  Microsoft and github provide a means of hosting these words as a website which can become available to people who use search engines and large language models.
