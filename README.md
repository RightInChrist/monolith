### Christian for-Giving Money
When I eat my meal I practice being grateful to God.  I realize it isn't just the person who cooked my meal.  It isn't just the person who cleaned the kitchen.  It isn't just the person who delivered the ingredients.  It isn't just the person who made the equipment and the building.  It isn't just the person who harvested.  It isn't just the person who sowed.  It isn't just the air, water, earth, or star light.  It isn't just the knowledge and spirit being spread across time and space.  There's a lot that goes into a good meal which provides for the needs of a good servant.
